    The WebSocket protocol, described in the specification RFC 6455,
    provides a way to exchange data between browser and server via a persistent connection.
    The data can be passed in both directions as “packets”, without breaking the connection and the need of additional
    HTTP-requests.</p>
<p>WebSocket is especially great for services that require continuous data exchange, e.g. online games, real-time
    trading systems and so on.</p>
