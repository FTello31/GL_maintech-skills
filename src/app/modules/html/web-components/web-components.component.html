<h1>
    Web Components

</h1>
<p>Web Components is a suite of different technologies allowing you to create reusable custom elements — with their
    functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your code — and utilize them in your web apps.</p>

<p>Web Components aims to solve such problems — it consists of three main technologies, which can be used together to
    create versatile custom elements with encapsulated functionality that can be reused wherever you like without fear
    of code collisions.</p>


<ul>
    <li><strong>Custom elements</strong>: A set of JavaScript APIs that allow you to define custom elements and their
        behavior, which can then be used as desired in your user interface.</li>
    <li><strong>Shadow DOM</strong>: A set of JavaScript APIs for attaching an encapsulated "shadow" DOM tree to an
        element — which is rendered separately from the main document DOM — and controlling associated functionality. In
        this way, you can keep an element's features private, so they can be scripted and styled without the fear of
        collision with other parts of the document.</li>
    <li><strong>HTML templates</strong>: The <a
            href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template"><code>&lt;template&gt;</code></a> and <a
            href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot"><code>&lt;slot&gt;</code></a> elements enable you to write markup
        templates that are not displayed in the rendered page. These can then be reused multiple times as the basis of a
        custom element's structure.</li>
</ul>
