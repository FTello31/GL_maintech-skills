<h1>Web Workers</h1>

<p>Web Workers are a simple means for web content to run scripts in background threads. The worker thread can perform
    tasks without interfering with the user interface. In addition, they can perform I/O using XMLHttpRequest (although
    the responseXML and channel attributes are always null) or fetch (with no such restrictions). Once created, a worker
    can send messages to the JavaScript code that created it by posting messages to an event handler specified by that
    code (and vice versa).

<p>A web worker is a JavaScript running in the background, without affecting the performance of the page.

<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">Web workers</a> lets you run CPU-intensive
    computations in a background thread, freeing the main thread to update the user interface.
    Application's performing a lot of computations, like generating Computer-Aided Design (CAD) drawings or doing heavy
    geometric calculations, can use web workers to increase performance.</p>
